<p>We never meet a stranger in our life time as much as body to the soul is not a stranger, each of our relationships in this life time is about giving us required experience for the journey of our soul.It is about the promise we made to our self and to our higher self before taking birth, that we begin to manifest each of those experiences which are required for our evolution.</p>
<p>We commonly dub our experiences in good and bad, happiness and pain and we continue to desire without knowing what is the purpose of our life. At spirit level as much as our inner level, each experience has its reason, purpose and teaching and each of the experience is good for the soul.</p>
<p>Let us decode the scientific reasons behind each of the these experiences. Let us begin to change our past and let us evolve with higher level of consciousness. Change is with efforts and driven by mind and will power but transformation requires little shift in the consciousness to manifest richness, joy and abundance.</p>
<p>Alternate healing such as Past life regression, Tantra, meditation are all tools but do not work unless we understand the science behind it and decode the mysteries in our life. This club is an initiative by some souls vibrating at similar frequency( albeit known as like minded people) who have traveled long distances in search of questions which concerns each one of us but we never found a satisfactory answers....</p>

Happiness comes from deep within, and not from people, situations, or circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Diego:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person&rsquo;s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends&rsquo; friends, and his friends&rsquo; friends&rsquo; friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since whatever we focus on grows, the aim of this group is to help members focus on happiness and to spread it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are a happy person and want to socialize and network with other happy people, this is for you. If your goal is to become a happier person this group is for you.

<p>R is an open source programming language for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization. R has an estimated one million users worldwide, and its user base is growing. While most commonly used within academia, in fields such as computational biology and applied statistics, it is gaining currency in commercial areas such as quantitative finance and business intelligence.</p>
<p>Among R's strengths as a language are its powerful built-in tools for inferential statistics, its compact modeling syntax, its data visualization capabilities, and its ease of connectivity with persistent data stores (from databases to flatfiles). In addition, R's open source nature and its extensibility via add-on ""packages"" has allowed it to keep up with the leading edge in academic research. For all its strengths, though, R has an admittedly steep learning curve; the first steps towards learning and using R can be challenging.</p>
<p>To this end, the New Delhi R Users Group is dedicated to bringing together area practitioners of R to exchange knowledge, inspire new users, and spur the adoption of R for innovative research and commercial applications.</p>",234694667,Zareef Ahmed

Life is best lived when you don’t try to demystify everything about life. You are not born for this or that! You are not here to book a place in the heaven or to have a coveted award bestowed upon you! You are here for the sheer joy of being useful: after all, the only other alternative is to be useless- to be used less. It happens often in our daily living that even if you do everything that you can do in life, still nothing will seem enough. So do you think the alternative is to give up and do everything and do nothing at all in life? Even if you do that still you are not going to be at peace with yourself, because life is not about how much or how less you do but it is all about getting tossed between the paradoxical needs of having and giving and eventually gaining the maturity to discover the middle path.</span></p>
<p><span>To help you walk on this middle path of life and to balance between the having and the giving process let’s talk about life and its various aspects. . It is going to be an open forum where we all will discuss whatever is mentioned above and of course anything apart from this that we would want to discuss.</span></p>

9694332,"Movie, Picnic, Social Work, World Travel, Meaningful Stuff",FreeSpiritsCommunity,https://www.meetup.com/FreeSpiritsCommunity/,4.86,1375819327e3,"<p>Welcome to Free Spirits Community. This is not just a random meet up group to meet random people every time but we are through these meet ups trying to build up a great community of free men/ women, where age, gender, nationality, social class or any man made classification is hardly an impediment, where all are equal and free and through this community we can experience a whole range of places, activities, skills and experiences in life that makes our life richer, vibrant and alive and a life wholly worth looking back.&nbsp;<span>Open arm welcome to all serious and decent people. Lets learn, talk and share and experience every shade and every beauty that life has to offer, complete, free &amp; uninhibited.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Objective of the meet up</span></strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><em>“A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><em> <br> </em></span></strong></p>
<p><span>The whole idea of this meet up group is to be happy, create and share it and be forever in pursuit of hope, peace and excellence. To learn skills, upgrade knowledge, make profound connections, socialize, have a light hearted time, engage in intelligent discussions, heart to heart talks, plan movies, plays, concerts, sport events, adventure travel by rail, road and air in country as well as international destinations, learn new sports, arts and hobbies for the sake of experience rather than professional training, try new cuisines, new places, new adventures expand our horizons, find for yourself as much as be for others a spiritual and emotional support group for everyone in the community. The objective is to find, create &amp; nurture a community for life, a big extended family, to be never left alone, unhappy and unsupported and lead a rich, vibrant, pulsating life worth looking back. This is not a group for walking-talking dead people with narrow and limited view of life lacking in energy and passion for life but for those who want to experience everything worthwhile in life before life makes them call quits. Through these meet ups we are trying to identify such people and bond with them for lifelong engagement and all others lacking in that passion and zest for life will be eliminated just like separating the wheat from the chaff. If you think your a potential worthy member of this group and aspire to experience and do everything worthwhile in life, engage with us to form our community. This can happen when we give as much as we expect. So take the initiative instead of being in your comfort zone and waiting for us or others.</span></p>
<p><span> <br> </span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important points that every member must know:</span></strong></span></p>
<ol> 
 <p><span>The ambit &amp; scope of activities are pretty wide and hence they are optional. Please feel free to participate only in those which match with your personality, interests and orientation.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>We do not sell or promote any product, service or workshop like a lot of other meet up groups nor would ever allow anyone to hijack our agenda of <em>“nirmal aanand”</em> by their personal motives. Workshop and travel package sellers etc, please excuse us. Any kind of business or commercial or political promotion is not allowed in our group and will lead to permanent extermination.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>We encourage healthy socializing amongst all irrespective of age, gender, social class but we are not a singles dating group and any&nbsp;heterosexual or homosexual flirting/ predating is not permitted under any&nbsp;circumstance.&nbsp;Any such conduct online or offline will lead to permanent extermination from the community. It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;matter whether you’re an introvert or extrovert.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>We are seeking active and energetic members who bring with them their passion and zest for life and sharing the same with like minded others. Members who just join but do not actively participate, a minimum 2 meet up in every quarter would lose their membership.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>To organize these meet up has a time, energy and money cost on the organizer. Nevertheless the membership is completely free and will always be. Third party cost such as museum/event/movie ticket, meals and travel etc cost are to be borne by every member.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>We actively seek members who bring with them management skills and a quest to share and execute innovative ideas. We truly appreciate such members and such doable, exciting and meaningful proposals would be accepted. People who bring such ideas and have a desire to organize and lead others would be given the chance to host/lead/manage.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>We do not believe in social stratification. As free men and woman, we do not discriminate on any man made classification. Please leave your pride and prejudices at home whenever you come to our meet ups. We don’t care whether one is a billionaire or an average man, studied @ Harvard or Govt. School. What matters for all is the dignity with which you conduct yourself and warmth and respect with which you treat others. Everyone at our meet up is a special person and must be treated with great respect.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>Please do not lend/ borrow money to others in meet up.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>Ladies please exercise your discretion in sharing your number or email with fellow members. Do so only if you really want to or else just politely decline by saying, No thanks. Your being a member&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;makes you obligated to share contact information with other members unless you also want to. If anyone harasses you even slightly at our meet up or subsequently, we shall have little hesitation in debarring that member outrightly at your first reporting to us.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p><span>Please be very polite while posting comments/ seeking information. Derogatory remarks/ abusive language would not be accepted. Do not post unwarranted greetings or send unsolicited messages to other members. All indiscipline will be dealt decisively and firmly.</span></p> 
</ol>
<ol> 
 <p>The Organizer may seek feedback and suggestion from members whenever required and you should always respond to such questions as a rule. In case of any dispute, disagreement, organizer's decision shall be final and binding upon all and the last word. If you have any grievance that you think is unfair, You can respectfully request or state your case over phone/email. Alternatively you can leave the group without losing a moment. Be fair, peaceful, objective, flexible and cooperative online or in meet ups offline. Do not show any ego/ attitude/impoliteness/negativity to us or any member. Such members will be permanently removed &nbsp;right away.</p> 
</ol>
<p><strong><span>RSVP Guideline:</span></strong></p>
<ol> 
 <p>A lot of application for membership to our community are rejected when members through their profile answers/ interest list &nbsp;are unable to establish their genuine intent in becoming an active and healthy member of the group. Those who after joining the group, don't attend meetups, can be terminated anytime in 2/3 months without any prior notice.&nbsp;Please RSVP responsibly. If you are not able to make it to event after making an RSVP, change your RSVP at least 2 days prior to event. &nbsp;If you RSVP and don't turn up two times in a row, you will be out-rightly removed. No notice would be served. If the organizer or any of the event host calls you up for an event for which you've RSVPed you must be extremely polite and respectful to them. Being rude or display of attitude would lead to instant &amp; permanent removal. Coming for less duration than the intended duration of meetup (things as, will hop in little late and will have to leave early) is usually not acceptable, however exceptions can be made in genuine cases by prior intimation to organizer/event host.&nbsp;<span>We do the most unique and highly innovative meet ups that upgrades the experience</span><span>. It is very important to value the community and the people who invest their time and money for no gain and those who do not understand and appreciate the same, it should be pretty firmly be made clear that</span> <span>such members do not deserve to stay in this community.</span></p> 
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Whatsapp Group Guideline:</b></p>
<p>We have a main Whatsapp group titled Free Spirits Community and event specific sub-groups. Members will be added to event specific sub-groups if your RSVP'ed for any event when the Whatsapp group for same would be created. Members who turn up at events may also get added to main Whatsapp group depending upon seat availability as Whatsapp groups does not allow more than 100 members. To accommodate new members who are more active/ enthusiastic and confirmed for events, it might require &nbsp;some old members to be removed especially those who are not active on Whatsapp group and/or not turning up at events regularly. All other guidelines to be observed are same as already mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At the end, it is important to realize that we are trying to build a positive and tightly held all-round support community for you and us both. If you don’t take sufficient initiative, be appreciative and encouraging of what we are trying to do, the idea of such a happiness bank and all round all life support community would remain a distant dream, an ideal of an idealist. The loss would be as much yours as much as ours. So do your bit in actively engaging with us and all others and be a regular active member of the community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><em>“If you go looking for a friend, you're going to find they're very scarce.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>If you go out to be a friend, you'll find them everywhere.”</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Future Plans:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Some of you may want to live for some time every year with other fellow members and live a free uninhibited life. And some of you particularly those eternally free spirits and single for life or those dreaming of retiring early may wish to live permanently in such a community. If we get active support from like minded people such as yours who also aspire for the same, then we hope to build an alternative community and give a permanent address to our community. It would fetch you the opportunity to live in the community’s home on hills (during summer) and near the sea (during winters) with other fellow members. You can play games, visit each other’s rooms or sit in the central hall and gossip, debate, joke, watch TV, go out for movies, plays, concerts, sports and live like a huge joint family of friends and fellow community members. You would be in possession of your room but if your family or work commitment pull you away from time to time, the room would be provided to the next member. Charges for Food, electricity, security guards and other maintenance charges have to be shared by community members as per actual cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that currently we do not own any such premises on the hills or near the sea but the idea has been mooted with the objective of giving a permanent address to the community and to meet the aspiration of those who would now or in future want to live with fellow community member and learn and share the joys of life. All members who show an interest now would be consulted before finalizing such a property. If this sounds close to what you aspire, let us know at the earliest.</p>

In such challenging times, one feels the need of a friend, a support system to fall back upon. One tries to sort it all out and find clarity and direction, which feels like an impossible thing to do alone. But TOGETHER we can...and this is what our group is all about.</p>
<p> This is a group for people who wish to celebrate life...with its gifts and challenges. Here, we intend to form a close knit community, where people would work together to make their and others' lives better-- by providing mutual support in tough times. We would also party hard in great times:))The group activities would involve--sharing thoughts, lunch/dinner/party meet ups creating happy times and possibly outstation trips. <strong>We want to expand slowly and steadily and would want to be a meaningful group, contributing in a positive way towards the life of its members. So, people who are genuinely interested to build enriching friendships and support system may only join.</strong></p>
<p>So much for an introduction....:)) More as we grow along!!!</p>
<p>So come on all wonderful people out there....let's explore life together...let's live it up to the fullest!</p>

<p><span>Your interest can be creative writing of any kind, be it short stories, poetry, non fiction or a novel. The level and skill in writing is not a deciding qualification too...an enthusiasm to write and participate with others in giving and receiving feedback and ideas is enough to be able to join. Both English and Hindi languages are fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Together we will aim to improve our skill and craft through regular writing exercises, but more importantly we aim to stay motivated, and motivate fellow members, by positive feedback and healthy sharing of Ideas and critique.</span></p>
<p>The group will meet at regular frequency at convenient and charming locations, like a quiet restaurant, a monument, a park or such. We will also attempt to invite established writers and teachers to our meetups. Depending on the participation level, we may even organise formal writing workshops.</p>
<p>While the core idea is to share and improve our writing, there will be added element of fun with food outings, movies and concerts or any such activities that the group decides.</p>
<p>Cheers and see loads of you there!</p>",21170191,hersh bhardwaj

The idea is to&nbsp;hold discussions about books from both fiction and non-fiction genres, which have influenced us in shaping our life's philosophy, or which have stimulated our intellectual senses, or which&nbsp;have simply given us pleasure in reading. Some of our favourite authors have been Arundhati Roy, Noam Chomsky, Romila Thapar, Paulo Coelho, Gabriel Garcia&nbsp;Marquez, Khushwant Singh, Ruskin Bond, Aldus Huxley, Margaret Atwood, and many more. </p>
<p>Another objective of the group is to have meaningful conversations about national and international political issues to enrich our knowledge and form sound opinions about the same as responsible citizens. We like to engage in wide-ranging&nbsp;issues&nbsp;related to&nbsp;nationalism, environmentalism,&nbsp;feminism, capitalism, and other ideologies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our members come from different professional and social backgrounds, which adds more substance and&nbsp;perspectives to our discussions. To make the group more participative, our members&nbsp;give suggestions for the books and issues to be discussed in our meetups. </p>
<p>Our group was earlier known as the West Delhi Books and Politics Club as we were organising our meetups in this part of the city for last 3.5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now expanding our geographical scope keeping in mind the long commuting time of our members coming from other parts of Delhi.&nbsp;In short, our meetup venues will now be anywhere in Delhi! We usually meet&nbsp;during post-lunch hours on&nbsp;weekends (as discussions sound better over evening coffee on a holiday!), and we meet once every couple of months on average. </p>
<p>So, if&nbsp;you have a passion for books (reading, borrowing, or&nbsp;hording!), and are deeply interested in learning about&nbsp;political issues, then this is the group for you! Join us for some intense and interesting intellectual discussions! </p>

<p>Started this that if everyone donates just 10 Minutes of their time for a novel cause which will spread the happiness in the world. There are major problems in this world like Tobacco, Alcohol, Cruelty against animals, Children education etc. the major root of this problem is that society do not give 10 Minutes to themselves, their children or society. Today the Violence against women and societies is a global pandemic of alarming proportions. No country is free of the scourge, no socio-economic class is exempt from its destructive effects. It takes place within homes, on the streets, in schools, Workplaces and refugee camps, and is prevalent whether in times of peace or during crises and conflicts. Its many forms include domestic violence, rape and sexual abuse, trafficking and sexual exploitation, feticides, and harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting. Gender-based violence impoverishes and harms not only women and girls, but also communities and societies as a whole. Our Goal is to connect with society with common desire and commitment to build a people centered and development oriented information society where one can create, access, utilize and share the information and their experience enabling the society, individuals and followers to the next Level for improving the quality of life of others We just want to contribute just a drop in ocean it all takes 10 Minutes.

Indeed, all of us, consciously or subconsciously, are motivated in all we do by our need for happiness. A housewife strives for a neat and clean home, well-brought up children and a happy family for her to be happy with her own self. On the other hand husband aims to make more money so as to take care of his family. We chase money, health, fame, power, property and relationships, not for their own sake but for the satisfaction they promise. </p>
<p>The quest for happiness has taken mankind on many strange journeys. Many have arrived at destinations never imagined or thought. We lose our own ways and end up with rejections and sorrows. But if we live life consciously and knowing what we want rather than what others expect from us, we can end up living happily, says Harsh Arora. </p>
<p>An inspiring counselor for behavioral competencies and stressed relationships, he has worked with companies like GE-Countrywide, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd, Wipro BPO Solution Ltd, Hutchison Essar (now Vodafone) and American Express in various capacities. Being in different positions in multi-cultural work environment he got the opportunity to study complexities of human behavior and gain in-depth knowledge and insight experiences. </p>
<p>Harsh Arora a young, vivacious and highly focused trainer who conducts workshops and motivational sessions all over India, so as to bring out the best amongst people. He has taken up a responsibility to add value to people lives by motivating them to adopt the principles of happiness in form of Self Acceptance, Self Responsibility, Self Assertiveness, Purposeful Living and Personal Integrity. </p>

<p>For Harsh, he has to go a long way adding a little bit of 'Harsh' in everyone's life.</p>
<p>Driven by his inner desire of contributing to the society he is constantly improving people's lives by removing obstacles in their path of success and happiness. </p>
<p>Harsh's talks are exciting, innovative, and powerful, which gives you a tool to create passion in life and keep you hanging to every word said by him. The goal of every keynote speech differs. His goal is to educate and stimulate minds by touching the right chord of emotions, and challenge the existing boundaries of will power to make a difference and lead a positive life. </p>
<p>Harsh's motivational training workshops and Motivational Keynote Speeches have a deep perspective yet astounding simplicity. You will experience high energy with clear communication which touches your heart with the right message. </p>
<p>Anger Management, Motivation, Leadership, Positive Attitude &amp;amp; Self Esteem, Inculcating Effective Relationships and Human Values, Stop Fearing Start Winning, Spiritual Leadership, Relationship Management, Winning with Teamwork, Stress Management, Time Management, Success, Change, Team Building, Law of Attraction, Goal Setting &amp;amp; Achieving, Dealing with Failure are some topics Harsh speaks on apart from highly effective, interactive and customized workshops.</p>

Friendship is the best concept and all other activities revolve around it. What I mean to say is, we can enjoy other activities more if we are real friends first. So this group is about friendship.</p>
<p>Hello, if you are looking for genuine, loyal and trustworthy friends for life, you have come to the right place. It's not just about getting together, have a good time and leave. Of course, we will travel, we will party, we will have fun and I'm open to your suggestions and views but the main aim of this group is to help it's members with true heart in any way possible. We all have times in our lives when we need someone to talk to, to get assistance in those dark hours, something which can be shared with a gem of a friend. Unfortunately, what is left today is just casual friendships, for the name of it. But I'm still hopeful that there are quality people who care for others' feelings and emotions. So people who think likewise and act likewise, you are welcome to join! A true friend is one of the most important relations in this world. No matter what we achieve, without a good friend, we are lacking. LET'S BECOME REAL FRIENDS IN THIS JOURNEY OF OUR LIVES, AND TRAVEL TOGETHER.. NO ONE TO BE LEFT BEHIND.</p>
<p>All important things to be taken care of here. Please read what this group is all about and understand it, before joining. There won't be many male members here as they mostly join with bad intentions. They are trouble makers as I can tell from my past experience. I will welcome only decent guys. The second thing is that I'm 37 so if you belong to this age group, or more in age, you are welcome to join as I'm making this club of great likeminded friends. And I'm making this forever. It's to keep. It's for keeps. Pls pls pls don't be money minded here if you want to feel that school time friendship again. I hope, you know what I mean. If we think about money or other things, we can never open up as close humans, thus can never become close friends. It's the happiness that counts. This is gonna be from heart and heart is all what we need. Just be good and respect others. So if you think, you are up to it, join in. Trust me, and you will enjoy the time of your life from here on. For all this to happen, I need your support. I would like the people who meet each other, extremely happy and content, and become friends, not just contacts, not someone you met once n remember by name or face.

<p><b>Shaktipunj</b></p>
<p><span>There is a constant debate about women safety in India. Whether it is Nirbhaya’s case or thousands of women suffered before and after her brutal murder. Sexual crimes are personal attack on women’s minds and bodies, instilling fear and violating a woman’s right to bodily integrity, education, and freedom of movement.</span><br></p>
<p>According to a survey, women are nine times more likely than are men to leave their jobs as a result of sexual crimes. </p>
<p>All of us have <b>Pre and Post Roles</b> to play to ensure women safety; be it law, police, society, family and organizations. A collective effort can make our world a better place to live-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is Shaktipunj</b></p>
<p>Shaktipunj (शक्तिपुंज) is a program to empower women with the art of self defense to protect their life, honour and self esteem. All women can learn it and they should, because even basic training can be of great help at the time of attack.</p>
<p><b>Why become a Shaktipunj</b></p>
<p>Sexual crimes frequently occur on the street, in the workplace, in educational institutions and on public and private transportation. Women have to take charge of their own safety. </p>
<p><i>According to National Crime Records Bureau 2013 report, everyday approx. 1000 women in India suffer from sexual crimes in one form or the other, be it eve teasing, domestic violence, sexual harassment, kidnapping, molestation or rape. </i></p>
<p><b>How to become a Shaktipunj</b></p>
<p>Take initiative to learn the art of <b>Self-Defense (Street Fight)</b> to protect first yourself and your family and then may be your friends, neighbors and colleagues. </p>
<p><i>Remember, when we are attacked, only our weaknesses defeat us BUT ‘Self Defense’ prepares us to attack on the weaknesses of criminals to defeat them. </i></p>
<p><b>Myths &amp; Facts</b></p>
<p><span><b>Myth:&nbsp;</b>We are weak hence can’t fight criminals.</span> <br></p>
<p><b>Fact: Your bones are equally strong and powerful. </b></p>
<p><b>Myth:&nbsp;</b>We can’t learn self defense. </p>
<p><b>Fact:&nbsp;Every woman can learn it easily. </b></p>
<p><b>Myth:&nbsp;</b>Our bodies will become muscular. </p>
<p><b>Fact:&nbsp;It doesn’t show outside but can save your life.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p><b>Myth:&nbsp;</b>We have to invest a lot of time. </p>
<p><b>Fact:&nbsp;Few hours per week for life saving skills, power and fitness.&nbsp;</b></p>

Whether it be writing, illustrating, animating or developing a game, we wonder - what makes ‘play’ possible? How do we encounter the ‘play’ with words and pictures, animation and accessory? And then what does ‘play’ means in an everyday learning environment and how is it useful? We hope to explore play in all its polysemy: the gaming of play, play in domestic, public, virtual spaces of sport and leisure and the embodiment &amp; practice of play. Jumpstart 2014 in Bangalore will inspire you with Panel Discussions and presentations by our eminent speakers and Workshops by an award winning author and renowned illustrator.

Brief: Entrepreneurship is a mind game to a greater extent than what is commonly perceived as the game of money. Its course is very dynamic but the basic principles of Successful Entrepreneurship remain the same. The Success Story of an Entrepreneur differs in form in comparison to others but the core remains the same. Hence, the experiences of the Highly Successful Business Leaders &amp; the insights they possess will be of huge impact in inspiring the current generation of young entrepreneurs towards building world class organizations which will in turn contribute to our economy in a big way. There are opportunities in every field for young entrepreneurs to make the best use of &amp; many youngsters have been achieving grand success all across the globe particularly in China &amp; the West. It is a well known fact that many self made billionaires have emerged in the recent past just with in no time &amp; it is researched that there is so much likeliness for many to emerge from South Asian countries in the coming decade. Thanks to technology, innovative ideas &amp; disruptive thinking. What it took decades is being made possible just within a couple of years. Our India today stands at a very advantageous position for two big reasons- One, our nation is with a great pool of talented youth who potential if put to the best use shall re-write the history of our nation as the most prosperous &amp; happy one in the world. Second, we have as our PM a dynamic leader who is with a clear vision to place our India on the top of the world. How can we put the best gift of our life time in its optimum mode? Ideas are brewing up in every corner of our India in the minds of our youth. Atleast a few of them are no less than a google, a face book, an apple, a microsoft, a samsung, a toyota, a nokia, a walmart or a zara. Each of them would have the potential to boost our economy &amp; place our nation in a comfortable position at the global level. Since Independence, a few great business minds have made it big despite several odds and today, the business eco system is quiet encouraging with many challenges like licence raj, quota system &amp; permits being wiped off. The Govt is increasingly being in support of entrepreneurs in recognition of their prominent role for boosting our economy. Business as an institution has been positively being recognized as a vital force to reckon for a bright future of our nation. It will be a dream coming true if our nation could give birth to the maximum number of self made first generation entrepreneurs &amp; the time for this is very much ripe now. This seems to be a herculean task but that gets rolling smoothly if &amp; only if ‘The youth will be ignited to take up entrepreneurship not as a means of livelihood but as a means of nation building’. As a step in the right direction, our DELHI CEO Group initiates one such wonderful event where the Corporate Captains across the industries will be invited to share their success journey, business insights &amp; also about how they have overcome the toughest challenges in their respective missions to build world class organizations like Tata, Reliance, Infosys, Whipro, L&amp;T, Mahindra&amp; Mahindra, Aditya Birla Group &amp; others. This mission shall give birth to many Dhirubai Ambanis, J R D Tatas, Narayan Murthys &amp; all.

17248242,Noida Filmmaking Meetup,Noida-Filmmaking-Meetup,https://www.meetup.com/Noida-Filmmaking-Meetup/,0,1411844333e3,"<p>I am looking for a few buddies who are interested in film-making and have some resources to pool such as cameras, lenses, lights, etc. and further our study of film-making.</p>
<p><b>Background</b><br>

</p>
<p>I have a Nikon D3100 and some decent lenses. However, I feel helpless because I would like to shoot some video with multiple cameras from different angles, different lenses and compare the footage, color grade some footage, edit video, may be have someone drive me around in my car while I shoot video, or I could drive and they could shoot video, but I don't have any friends.<br>

</p>
<p><b>Must-have's to join this group</b><br>

</p>
<p>Please join this group if, and only if:<br>

</p>
<p>• You own a DSLR or a mirrorless camera and some lenses and are interested in making films and/or learning how to make films; and</p>
<p>• You live in Noida; and</p>
<p>• You have your own conveyance.</p>
<p>Those three are must-haves to join this group.</p>
<p><b>Nice to have's but not necessary to join this group</b><br>

</p>
<p>In addition, even though it is not required, it would be nice if:</p>
<p>• You also had a digital video workstation, i.e. a computer with some serious non-linear video editing and composition software;</p>
<p>• You already edit video;</p>
<p>• You own some lighting equipment</p>
<p><b>What this group is <i>not</i>:</b></p>
<p>1) I am not looking for people who expect that we'll all sit and talk about film-making and share our knowledge and shit. Only losers sit and share knowledge. Learning is an individual, single-person activity. No long meetings, no pizza, no beverages, nothing. Just silence, camera, lenses, thinking, observing, going back home.<br>

</p>
<p>2) This group is not to make some film or something.</p>
<p>3) This is not a film making school or tuition. I am myself a learner. If you're looking for a school or something that will teach you how to make films, you probably will never make films.</p>
<p><b>What this group <i>is</i>:</b></p>
<p>We all will just come together whenever we have time and shoot video of whatever we like. No one will impose on anyone what to shoot and what not to shoot.</p>
<p>Basically, the purpose is just to share whatever cameras, lenses, lights and things we have. Because I have only 1 camera and 3 lenses, you might have a different camera from mine and different lenses, if I use yours and you use mine, we both get exposure to more than one camera without buying any extra gear. That's it.</p>
<p>And we might ask of each other things that will help us in our study of film-making.<br>

</p>
<p>For e.g. I might ask someone in the group to shoot my video from 3 different angles and then I take home the footage to study. You might do the same. Or, we might go together somewhere and film something helping each other. One person may hold the camera, another pull focus, another move the lights, etc.<br>

</p>
<p>This is not to teach one another anything or to sit and discuss things. It's going to be very individual. We basically meet, silently do our own things using each others' gear, and go our separate ways. We meet whenever we have time.<br>

<p><b>WE MEAN TO CLEAN</b> (WMTC) is a Delhi-NCR based volunteer group conducting spotfixes, cleanliness drives and awareness programs in the region. WMTC volunteers are a team of highly motivated people from different walks of life - ranging from students to working professionals - who want to realize the dream of a clean Delhi and a clean India - Swachh Bharat. We believe that keeping our city and country clean is not only the responsibility of government alone but that of citizens like us too! Hence, we engage in 'shramdaan' or donation of effort on a weekly/ fortnightly basis. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
<p>There's only one requirement to join us: You must be driven by the realization that this country can be cleaned up only through citizen-led action, and be endlessly motivated to make (and not just see) a cleaner Delhi, and a cleaner India. <br></p>
<p><b>Group Rules:</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;RSVPing for a meetup is mandatory. An RSVP ‘Yes’ followed by a ‘no show’ would require a reason for the back-out. First instance shall be excusable basis the reason. However, second instance shall lead to immediate termination of membership.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Attendance at least once a quarter is mandatory. Those unable to maintain this would be removed from the group. Cases related to any personal/ other issues shall be dealt with separately. Members actively contributing in ways other than clean-up drives would be exempted from this.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Any cases of unsolicited advances towards our female members shall be taken very seriously and such members shall be removed from the group without any prior warning or communication.</p>

Do you just go ""awwww"" when you see ANY dog, pet or stray doesn't matter (ferocious and calm, may :P )?? Would you like to take your furry, four-legged friends out for fun time, with other folks and their friendly dogs, who'd love them and enjoy their company just as much, if not more?? Would you like to play with other friendly dogs and help your dog get friendly with other people and their dogs?? If yes, then this group is for you!!</span><br>

</p>
<p>The objectives of this group are:</p>
<p>• to do weekly meet-ups, with our canine friends; </p>
<p>• take them out and meet other people with their dogs and play with them; </p>
<p>• help your dogs get social; </p>
<p>• maybe throw a ball or a frisbee for the doggies to have fun; and</p>
<p><span>• </span><span>organize several fun events, like Doggie Lunches/brunches/pot-lucks, Doggie Dates, Doggie Games etc.</span></p>
<p><br>

</p>
<p>How did the idea come to my mind?? Well, I have a 5 years old Golden Lab -- Bruno (I named him Scooter, but my Ma said, ""Kya ab kutton ka naam bhi tum Cycle, Scooter, Rickshaw rakhogey??"" :D  So, she lovingly named him Bruno, the quintessential Indian Lab name..  :P  Anyways, coming back to the point. Bruno, now lives with my family, in Gujarat. Although, they've recently moved (temporarily) to Gujarat, but, in these past couple of months, I've missed my boy like crazies.</p>
<p>Since, I was terribly missing my boy, Bruno, I started searching for an online meet-up group to maybe get together with dog lovers and meet their furry friends, to play and have fun with. Sadly and strangely, I couldn't find any! Hence, this meet-up group.</p>
<p>This group is for people who'd love to hang-out with people who have a pet dog and/or who'd love to take their dogs out for a fun meet-up. I'm not sure how this will work for the different breeds, haven't tried this before! But, I'd love to try and see if this works, for good. Anyone who has a dog or would love to play with dogs, can join.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Let's Leash (or not, if they're trained) your doggies and bring them to the meet-up, to let people like me enjoy their company!! It's gonna be awesome fun time, I guarantee! ;D</p>
<p>P.S.: We can also plan doggie vacations, where you will NOT have to think about sadly leaving your dog best friend back home and stay worried all the time. These shall be called Doggie Getaways! </p>
<p>Let's do this!!! :D</p>

And I always go like ahhhh... maybe you should meet more people. Remember the girl who smokes marijuana? She is cool. And what about that guy with the dreadlocks? He is fucking Interesting.

18211755,Help Human Being Foundation,Help-Human-Being-Foundation,https://www.meetup.com/Help-Human-Being-Foundation/,0,1416849354e3,"“If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.” - Dalai Lama “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.” - Dalai Lama Too often the trend in our society is for people to be separated from either other, to be cut off from the great mass of humanity, and in doing so to be dehumanized a little bit more with each step. Cars have taken us off the streets, where we used to greet each other and stop to chat. Cubicles have taken away a bit of the humanity in working, as have factories and even computers to some extent. Television has planted us firmly in our living rooms, instead of out with other people. Even movie theaters, where many people get together, cut us off from true conversation because we’re staring at a big screen. And while I’m not railing against any of these inventions (except perhaps the cubicle), what we must guard against is the tendency of that individuality to have us focused on ourselves to the exclusion of our fellow human beings. The tendency towards selfishness rather than giving, on helping ourselves rather than helping our brothers and sisters in humanity. I’m not saying we’re all like that, but it can happen, if we’re not careful. So strike back against the selfishness and greed of our modern world, and help out a fellow human being today. Not next month, but today. Helping a fellow human being, while it can be inconvenient, has a few humble advantages: It makes you feel better about yourself; It connects you with another person, at least for a moment, if not for life; It improves the life of another, at least a little; It makes the world a better place, one little step at a time; And if that kindness is passed on, it can multiply, and multipy. So take just a few minutes today, and do a kindness for another person. It can be something small, or the start of something big. Ask them to pay it forward. Put a smile on someone’s face. Don’t know where to start? Here’s an extremely incomplete list, just to get you thinking — I’m sure you can come up with thousands more if you think about it. Smile and be friendly. Sometimes a simple little thing like this can put a smile and warm feeling in someone else’s heart, and make their day a little better. They might then do the same for others. Call a charity to volunteer. You don’t have to go to a soup kitchen today. Just look up the number, make the call, and make an appointment to volunteer sometime in the next month. It can be whatever charity you like. Volunteering is one of the most amazing things you can do. Donate something you don’t use. Or a whole box of somethings. Drop them off at a charity — others can put your clutter to good use. Make a donation. There are lots of ways to donate to charities online, or in your local community. Instead of buying yourself a new gadget or outfit, spend that money in a more positive way. Redirect gifts. Instead of having people give you birthday or Christmas gifts, ask them to donate gifts or money to a certain charity. Stop to help. The next time you see someone pulled over with a flat tire, or somehow in need of help, stop and ask how you can help. Sometimes all they need is a push, or the use of your cell phone. Teach. Take the time to teach someone a skill you know. This could be teaching your grandma to use email, teaching your child to ride a bike, teaching your co-worker a valuable computer skill, teaching your spouse how to clean the darn toilet. OK, that last one doesn’t count. Comfort someone in grief. Often a hug, a helpful hand, a kind word, a listening ear, will go a long way when someone has lost a loved one or suffered some similar loss or tragedy. Help them take action. If someone in grief seems to be lost and doesn’t know what to do, help them do something. It could be making funeral arrangements, it could be making a doctor’s appointment, it could be making phone calls. Don’t do it all yourself — let them take action too, because it helps in the healing process. Buy food for a homeless person. Cash is often a bad idea if it’s going to be used for drugs, but buying a sandwich and chips or something like that is a good gesture. Be respectful and friendly. Lend your ear. Often someone who is sad, depressed, angry, or frustrated just needs someone who will listen. Venting and talking through an issue is a huge help. Help someone on the edge. If someone is suicidal, urge them to get help. If they don’t, call a suicide hotline or doctor yourself to get advice. Help someone get active. A person in your life who wants to get healthy might need a helping hand — offer to go walking or running together, to join a gym together. Once they get started, it can have profound effects. Do a chore. Something small or big, like cleaning up or washing a car or doing the dishes or cutting a lawn. Give a massage. Only when appropriate of course. But a massage can go a long way to making someone feel better. Send a nice email. Just a quick note telling someone how much you appreciate them, or how proud you are of them, or just saying thank you for something they did. Show appreciation, publicly. Praising someone on a blog, in front of coworkers, in front of family, or in some other public way, is a great way to make them feel better about themselves. Donate food. Clean out your cupboard of canned goods, or buy a couple bags of groceries, and donate them to a homeless shelter. Just be there. When someone you know is in need, sometimes it’s just good to be there. Sit with them. Talk. Help out if you can. Be patient. Sometimes people can have difficulty understanding things, or learning to do something right. Learn to be patient with them. Tutor a child. This might be difficult to do today, but often parents can’t afford to hire a tutor for their child in need of help. Call a school and volunteer your tutoring services. Create a care package. Soup, reading material, tea, chocolate … anything you think the person might need or enjoy. Good for someone who is sick or otherwise in need of a pick-me-up. Lend your voice. Often the powerless, the homeless, the neglected in our world need someone to speak up for them. You don’t have to take on that cause by yourself, but join others in signing a petition, speaking up a a council meeting, writing letters, and otherwise making a need heard. Offer to babysit. Sometimes parents need a break. If a friend or other loved one in your life doesn’t get that chance very often, call them and offer to babysit sometime. Set up an appointment. It can make a big difference. Love. Simply finding ways to express your love to others, whether it be your partner, child, other family member, friend, co-worker, or a complete stranger … just express your love. A hug, a kind word, spending time, showing little kindnesses, being friendly … it all matters more than you know. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a weary world. - William Shakespeare",182649531,Rahul

<p>This project is to help vigilant parents to let them identify right skills and opportunities for their kids so that these kids can hone these relevant skills and become successful in the future. <br></p>
<p>There are three main challenges for your kids in the future. Economical, Ecological &amp; Equity. <br></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><b>Economical</b> | World Economic Forum says Technology is going to impact humankind on such a scale as humankind has an experience never before. Technology will replace the human being in many places, and so we need to hone newer kinds of skills to sustain our future. <br></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><b>Ecological</b> | Water, Air, food are all basic necessity of life, which is getting scarce every passing day. Our kids are going to have a tough time if we will not going to work now. <br></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><b>Equity</b> | With a changing needs of the jobs, many people will be unskilled for the jobs in future. They will not have jobs and crime will go high. <br></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>So there is a huge need to let the kids learn the ways to solve these wicked problems. And this group is a platform to brainstorm and find solutions for kids, which must be Fun and should be a huge opportunity to learn.</p>

<p>So you have found us in this life as well.</p>
<p>When we created this page, we did not anticipate we'd come this far. We began with our common heart of love, and not the intellect to explore new horizons of Spirituality, Nirvana, and Enlightenment.</p>
<p>In 1998, amongst many, life tripped us over from the border ignorance to the land of interrogation. Was this destined?, was as it free will at that moment of choice? , or, was it neither?; only a fully enlightened being may be able to answer that. It was then we started our journey towards self, as well as world betterment, by exploring the true nature of the mind.</p>
<p>On a spiritual journey, many of us&nbsp;<span>have had encounters with strangers who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, to hint us, and then disappear.&nbsp;For some reason, we did not attempt to stay in touch with them, yet we think that we are all alone in this excursion to the into.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the years a few amongst us,&nbsp;</span><span>with the help of the little whispering voice of the universe, or, a spiritual master/guru/teacher guides us and pulls us out from the moments of despair. This&nbsp;precisely, is what we must rejoice, and realize that that none of us is alone on this path. Moreover, we have each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All those moments of philosophical thoughts you may have contemplated</span><span>&nbsp;that makes this reality bleak is reassurance enough that you are partially enlightened. However, in order to be fully enlightened, must stop straying and begin channelization it instead.</span></p>
<p>Yes, I agree that there are no rules, but can we deny that there could be an easier way? Our ego can deny but our true self cannot, and that is why we seek. Channelization will bring is the&nbsp;easier way to the path. It connects us to the one within, and to each other.</p>
<p>Just because we are complex beings, we think we have to be more complex to&nbsp;attain spritual growth, however,&nbsp; enlightenment in its true essence, is the simplest form of awareness that you can have, like breaking it down to the simplest code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have you been hunting enlightenment like me, or, if you have already non-objectified the idea of grasping, but still find the idea of uniting with the&nbsp;beyond as a fascinating one, this place is for you.</p>
<p><span>It is time to move beyond the self-help&nbsp;books on success, business and life management. It is time to regain the ownership of your mind, its thoughts, and every action.</span><br></p>

We tend to instill poetry in everything in life. Remembering a verse or two when rain falls, finding rhyme and verses amidst mad rattling of business meetings and remembering chachaa ghalib’s line or two, suited for almost every occasion in life. We intend to share this madness with like-minded people, and at the same time, extend the ‘infection’ to some who are prone to it. We look forward to share the little that we feel and comprehend in poetry, and learn a lot more in the process. A poem gives you wings, takes you on a voyage, a parwaz, to an unexplored world at times, or providing a new perception of the known vistas at others. It can transport you back in time, to a different era altogether, or it can take you to a world where human feelings are same beyond all caste, color and boundaries.. And then some parwaz will make you soar high, sit on a skyscraper and see your world with a ‘bird eye view’, making it all suddenly look a lot more meaningful. At Parwaz, we share our poetic voyages with you and look forward to hearing your journeys via poems too.</p>",136008152,Priyanka Bhaskar

They have surpassed the Basic need of Food, Cloths, House, Shelter; Money etc.Life has bigger meaning, beyond the daily mundane things.</p>

<p>Religion, Caste, Creed, Language, Boundaries of Nations can't stop the free souls of liberty &amp; Happiness. Let’s enjoy the Beauty of Mother Nature........</p>
<p>We live all things beautiful. We sing, love, dance and be creative. Committed towards transforming life into a blissful melody, we're all in the process of learning how to celebrate sadness, pain and even death. The process itself is liberating, and life is now flowering towards growth and peace, inwardly and outwardly. We celebrate what is expected, we also celebrate the unexpected, no matter how difficult it may look. With stress going down and celebration going up, we're totally in love with life as it is.</p>
<p>We also believe in peaceful co-existence and letting each one of us thrive without impinging on free will and right of others. Hence there are a few guidelines which each one of us is expected to adhere to:</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt; 1. <b>Respect your RSVP:</b> We value your time and expect you to value others' time too. If you are unsure of attending a meet up, do NOT RSVP.

If you are unable to change your RSVP, please make the effort of calling the event organizer in advance or texting him/her about your change in RSVP. If there are 3 no shows, we reserve the right to revoke the membership of such members.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt; 2. <b>Be a sincere participant:</b> We expect all members to attend at least one meet up in 3-6 months. If you do not RSVP and attend any meetup in 6 months time, we assume that you do not wish to participate in the group and hence, we may remove you from the group.</p>

We just feel like being disconnected with the world and spend some time for ourselves and rejuvenate ourselves for our materialistic life that we are living.</p>
<p>No doubt all of us have most comfortable homes where we live but still at our homes between our families we can’t connect to ourselves. As at our homes we are surrounded by duties that we perform endlessly, this is also a very important part of our lives. But it is also true that if we are not able to keep ourselves happy and if we are not happy we will not be able to keep others happy.</p>
<p>Trusting the above mentioned theory and believing in it we have decided to come up with a place where you can meet yourself, spend time and do things which we want to do. We are bringing things like meditation, yoga, book reading and even as simple thing as enjoying drinking coffee all under one roof. And what I find best about this place is that it is not bounded by time which means you can spend as much time as you want at no additional cost. And we assure you that this place is going to be a very special place for you and you will always be wanting to spend time in this place.</p>

Selective participation! Not everyone is allowed/invited. Do write to us with your details and ‘why’ you want to come along.  
Accommodation: Shogi (Shimla) a beautiful, small and calm town some 10 kilometers before Shimla. There is a small independent accommodating in the town’s housing complex. It has a washroom, 2 bedrooms (2 double beds and one single bed) and a kitchen. This all is in a very raw state. But, you know, it, still, is a roof over head. I will reach the place a day before and try to clean it myself. Just understand that it is only a very basic accommodation- as good as sleeping out there in the wilderness. Just do not expect much from the physical structure. If you want comfort that comes from ‘things’, we advise you to avoid coming.
Rules: 
1)	No drugs.
2)	No Nuisance.
3)	No illegal activities. 
Number of people: 6 to 8 (we will see.)
Time Period: 7 days; From 30.03.2015 to 05.04.2015

1)	It is very likely that there will be electricity and water. However, if there is no electricity and the moonlight doesn’t come to our rescue, we shall use candles and torches.

3)	You will be required to bear your own expenses for everything including food and travelling.

It is our first attempt. We hope you will coordinate with us. The mandatory contribution of Rs.1500 / Rs. 8000 (whichever applicable) once given will not be returned. In case of any dispute, the forum and the jurisdiction will be that of New Delhi.   
7) You have to intimate me of your desire to come by 25th of March, 2015.

1)	Show-off is not allowed. We are not into i-phones or Lamborghinis. We are about people, their personalities, content in their words and genuineness in their beings. 
2)	Be Simple. It would be good if you just wear a smile on your face and a t-shirt with pair of denims on your body. (Hope you got the point!) 
3)	Do bring a jacket or a sweater for it will get cold at night.
4)	Weather forecast says it will not rain. Do check it! And, if you ‘mind’ rain, please bring your umbrellas along. 
5)	A pair of sneakers will come in handy for we love walking. 
6)	Bring along your medicines or any other necessary things without which you cannot do.   
7)	There is a liquor shop down the hill, if you are into it. Suit yourself.
8)	 We do not have any music system. If you want to bring along any make-shift music system, you are welcome.
9)	Only good natured people are welcome. We do not need those who need a reason to be sad. We welcome those who want to be happy for no reason.

<p><span>Let us come together and share knowledge, experience and wisdom.&nbsp;</span><b> <br></b></p>
<p>The objective of this meetup group is to reinstate the faith of modern youth (both men and women) in our ancient Indian great institution of marriage. Premarital Education can play a vital role to foresee the RED-LIGHTS before jumping (or forced or pushed) in. <br><b>Why Premarital Education? <br></b>With fast pace or rat-race of career, technology and internet, marital relationships have taken backseat in our priority list. <br>Smallest unit of society is family which only a man and woman can make beautiful where the effervescence of happiness is oozing out continuously. <br>In the recent times, we have observed a severe discord in the marital relationship. Today’s youth finds it difficult to commit to the institution of marriage. The result is increasing number of separation and legal divorces which clearly indicates societal disintegration. <br>Alas! That even higher education, worldly exposure and development of mental faculties didn’t play the pivotal role to reinstate the faith of the new generation, rather many a times they become hardest obstacle. <br><b>To know more, please visit: <a href=""http://streamlinez.in/ws.html"" class=""linkified"">http://streamlinez.in/ws.html</a> <br></b>We have observed all the key elements of marital relationship critically and grouped them into <b>7 important categories</b> as follows: <br>1.

This is a group for all such people who are ""seriously"" interested in GMAT preparation and who can help each other grow concepts by regular discussions. As you must be facing difficulty in terms of discussions on your doubts/concept building in GMAT preparation, this group will help such people. This group does not have any professional instructors for GMAT. The group can help motivating each other, making schedule for preparation and strengthen the weak areas.

Moreover, it can be extended till final MBA admissions.

So whosoever is ""serious"" and interested, pls join and help each other in this journey..!!

<p>Emerging Brilliance is a business and personal development training company with a single focus: we help people tap into their own unique Brilliance. It is the No.1 Company optimising the MET training method. MET stands for Mind Empowering Technology. Our training programs are challenging, interactive and enjoyable. MET trains people in an experiential environment – “learning by doing”. We use games, simulations, NLP, hypnosis, discussions, individual assignments, group projects, exercises of all varieties and EFT so that the learning is fun, and you can enjoy its benefits for long after you leave the training room. We also invite experts from our worldwide network to provide inputs from their own areas of specialty to ensure leading edge content.</p>
<p>Started in March 2011, Emerging Brilliance is the result of Amandeep’s personal life experiences: coming from a single-room house in Calcutta with illiterate parents, struggling with being overweight and suicidal at the age of 16 and broke at 30, he went on to change his fate and is now an internationally renowned speaker presenting life-changing seminars all around the world. It made him realise that each individual holds an epitome of brilliance within themselves. To emerge as the shining star that we all are, we simply need to connect to the potential that we already have inside of us and accept ourselves completely. Once we explore new insights it automatically expands our comfort zone, which allows us to evolve into our brilliance. He believes that we can change our fate irrespective of our background, education, race, culture, skin colour, and linguistic abilities.</p>",190647568,Amandeep Thind

18812439,The Zeitgeist Movement Delhi Meetup,The-Zeitgeist-Movement-Delhi-Meetup,https://www.meetup.com/The-Zeitgeist-Movement-Delhi-Meetup/,5,1439014841e3,"<p>Founded in 2008, The Zeitgeist Movement is a sustainability advocacy organization, which conducts community based activism and awareness actions through a network of global/regional chapters, project teams, annual events, media and charity work.The movement’s principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social problems that plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, absolute scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of “human nature” or other commonly held assumptions of causality. Rather, the movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, pollution, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be “symptoms” born out of an outdated social structure. <br>While intermediate reform steps and temporal community support are of interest to the movement, the defining goal is the installation of a new socioeconomic model based upon technically responsible resource management, allocation and design through what would be considered the scientific method of reasoning problems and finding optimized solutions.</p>
<p>This “Natural Law/Resource-Based Economy” (NLRBE) is about taking a direct technical approach to social management as opposed to a monetary or even political one. It is about updating the workings of society to the most advanced and proven methods known, leaving behind the damaging consequences and limiting inhibitions which are generated by our current system of monetary exchange, profit, business and other structural and motivational issues.</p>
<p>The movement is loyal to a train of thought, not figures or institutions. The view held is that through the use of socially targeted research and tested understandings in science and technology, we are now able to logically arrive at societal applications that could be profoundly more effective in meeting the needs of the human population, increasing public health. There is little reason to assume war, poverty, most crime and many other monetarily-based scarcity effects common in our current model cannot be resolved over time. The range of the movement’s activism and awareness campaigns extend from short to long term, with methods based explicitly on non-violent methods of communication.</p>
<p>The Zeitgeist Movement has no allegiance to any country or traditional political platforms. It views the world as a single system and the human species as a single family and recognizes that all countries must disarm and learn to share resources and ideas if we expect to survive in the long run. Hence, the solutions arrived at and promoted are in the interest to help everyone on Earth, not a select group.</p>",188754074,Joydeep

However, handling the entire gamut of operations is difficult, especially in a small and medium enterprise.</p>

<p>Lend me your time...</p> 
<p>Life. That weirdly convoluted line joining our births to our deaths. A path that should have been straight, at the very least similar in most counts, if not for how differently each of us act and react, as governed by how differently we think. Thinking, the unquantifiable quantity that put humans on an enviable position on the food chain, from a rather vulnerable position. Thinking, the idea that I have been trying to reinforce from the beginning of this paragraph, albeit rather clumsily.</p> 
<p>This group, named after one of the most famous Thinker of all time, was made to Celebrate Thinking. And that means celebrating thoughts, ideas, and thinkers. And not just the thought, ideas, and thinkers among the famous. Among all of us. And what better way is there to celebrate these than through Logical discourse, a steaming mug of coffee* and new friends? That is, in short, what Delhi Socrates Café is all about.</p> 
<p>Now, you may think that philosophy is not your thing. I assure you, it most surely is. At the very least, you have been actively pursuing it most of your rational life. Not many of us here are formally trained in philosophy. Interest in new ideas, perspectives etc. is the only base eligibility criterion. If you need a place to voice your ideas, you have found it. You want time too? I will give you one, once each month. Basically, I will post one meetup each month. Come, participate and have fun.</p> 
<p>But there's one ground rule. You shall be civil to the others at the meetup. No rudeness. Debates are not about destroying your opponent. Its about proving your point or accepting that it was wrong, if proven otherwise. You can, of course, agree to disagree. But rude comments, personal affronts, attacks on character is one strike. And this isn't baseball, so two strikes and you're out.</p> 
<p>So, I guess that's about it. Hope to see you around.</p>",157699772,Ankit Manchanda

In this journey often,there are a lot of omen's you have to rely on before taking the next step.For eg in case of most successful ideas,success is mildly tasted somewhere in between process and product itself.The most challenging aspect really is what happens till then.And that's the real journey.</p>
<p>We plan to achieve following aims from these meetups :</p>
<p>1. Professional and Proven guidance to early stage founders.</p>

May be you never thought about pursuing your hobbies or passions till date and maybe you don't know that you have one. Hence, its time that you start. Retirement is the time when people should enjoy the freedom from responsibilities but you feel like you are just getting into a rut, doing the same old chores everyday and feeling that life is slipping away from your hands like sand. If this is the thing then we have already accepted you as a part of our family. What we will do? As a family we will plan to meet twice in a month (can be increased later) and take part in activities which will boost brain powers and have fun at the same time.

Have you ever felt happiness in your life... 
...never lasts? 
This Buddhist group has a great positive, multi-cultural atmosphere that helps people search for the answer to life's biggest questions. Through the teachings of Buddha and historical Pure Land Buddhist teachers we understand better the direction our life needs to take in order to find the purpose of life. 
We offer video lectures and have meetings to discuss how to obtain an absolute form of happiness. 
I hope you'll stop by and attend a meeting when you have a chance! 
Below, you'll find some more information about what Buddhism is all about as well as our contact info and location. 
In Buddhism, we learn that there are two kinds of joy. 
Relative Happiness 
All the happiness we know is called Relative Happiness. Money, status, fame, wealth, family, friends, and our loved ones are all included in this category. Politics, economics, medicine, and the arts also try to provide us with Relative happiness. 
We seek for this type of happiness day in, day out hoping we can attain true satisfaction from it. 
Absolute Happiness 
We are all seeking for a happiness which will truly last. This kind of happiness is called Absolute Happiness. The purpose of life is to attain it as quickly as possible while still alive.

First, meditation cuts across barriers of faith, religion, gender, cast and creed; and second, the practice of collective meditation is a powerful tool endorsed for centuries by all faiths, spiritual orders and saints for raising consciousness and bringing individual transformation at a deeper level.

It is also a hope of our group to promote cross-cultural dialogues, sharing, understanding, and peer supports through a variety of local activities and events, as well as international trips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a film buff, programmer, electronics enthusiast and an actor. Since I stepped in I noticed that the group has a serious problem. There is very little activity, and the members are all very bored. Listen, the world already considers us as boring people, we need to show the world that we are the best of them.</p>
<p>So, here are a few ground rules; <br></p>
<p>• This is a gender-neutral group, and women who are interested in technology, programming, electronics will be warmly welcomed. Participation by women will be strongly encouraged.</p>
<p><span>• The group shall meet more frequently, and have fun. All of us work very hard in our professions, but this group is for fun so we can share our binary jokes, run in while loops until the beer goes out and use our soldering rods to make delicious snacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>• No one here is an instructor, we are all friends and collaborators and we shall work together on projects that we can show off.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>• Periodically we shall get together and celebrate each other's birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions. Since the world has chosen to label us as antisocial, we shall form our own society, with our own rules.</span></p>
<p>• Each year we will put up one major show / installation or exhibition of our projects, designs and ideas that the entire group will participate in. This will be our chance to be famous. </p>
<p>More rules to be added with your suggestions as we go along and progress together.</p>
<p>Bring out the best in yourself and share it with the world is our motto and it will remain so until we are a few beers down.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you like the change in leadership and have your faith restored in the destiny that awaits us. For those of you who feel that it is not right, the door is always open.</span></p>

<p>We want to spread awareness about the extra ordinarily benefits of Bitcoin Mining as the most profitable technique of making millions in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>A small intro to Bitcoin Mining:</p>
<p>People are sending bitcoins to each other over the bitcoin network all the time, but unless someone keeps a record of all these transactions, no-one would be able to keep track of who had paid what. The bitcoin network deals with this by collecting all of the transactions made during a set period into a list, called a block. It’s the miners’ job to confirm those transactions, and write them into a general ledger.<br></p>
<p>So, that’s how miners ‘seal off’ a block. They all compete with each other to do this, using software written specifically to mine blocks. Every time someone successfully creates a hash, they get a reward of 25 bitcoins, the blockchain is updated, and everyone on the network hears about it. That’s the incentive to keep mining, and keep the transactions working.<br></p>
<p>BItcoin value is growing at the fastest ever pace, one can track the growth on Bitcoin over internet through Google and be assured of the growth pattern. It has been accepted by more than 186 countries across globe. So be a part of this fastest growing digital currency and get the most out of it.</p>

It is an ancient wisdom of realising the Self Consciousness and uniting it with the Cosmic Consciousness. The Bhagavad Gita refers to the same Kundalini Kriya Yog as ""The Pran Apan Anusandhan"".</p>
<p>Benefits of Kundalini Kriya Yog:</p>
<p>Learn the alchemy of total transformation from Man to God. Be the architect of your happiness; the secret lies within. &lt;br&gt;1. Kaya Kalp - retarding, arresting &amp; reversing the decay and ageing process of the body &lt;br&gt;2. Kosha Swasthya - healing the physical, emotional, mental and astral bodies &lt;br&gt;3. Shuddering - cleansing of the chakras &lt;br&gt;4. Jagruti - Awakening of the Kundalini &lt;br&gt;5. Karma Nirmulan - Diversion, dilution and eradication of karma</p>
<p>About the Sat Guru: &lt;br&gt;Yog Martand Yogiraj Siddhanath descends from the Solar Dyanasty of Maharaja Ikshavaku and Prabhu Shree Ramachandra. The great Kings and lofty Yogis of this ancient dynasty have been custodians of the sacred science of Raj Yog and Kriya Yog. Yogiraj Siddhanath's transformation was completed in the Himalayas by his deep and personal experience with Maha Avatar Babaji who blessed and empowered him to teach Kriya Yog. &lt;br&gt;While upholding the authenticity of the Classical Kriya Yog and empowering his disciples the world over into the same, Yogiraj Siddhanath has further modified it. His revolutionary school of Yog encompasses ""Siddhanath Hamsa Yog"", ""Siddhanath Surya Yog"" and many more dimensions to enlighten the path of the seeker on the journey to Eternal Wisdom.</p>",NA,NA

Whether you are a single person startup, a family business heir or have an established &nbsp;business, you are welcome to join. We are industry agnostic and in fact embrace professional diversity. The idea is to host mixers and guest speakers for people to mingle, socialize and learn from each other's experiences and perspectives. In order to ensure relevance, we will be screening members. In order to gain membership, you must be-</p>
<p>1. Gay, Lesbian, Transgender or Bisexual- Bisexual members must demonstrate that they are willing to engage with the LGBT community. 2. Having a legitimate and active running business that is currently trading. This is not a group for those looking to set up ventures of their own. All members can be rest assured that confidentiality will be strictly respected. It also must be made clear that this is NOT a party to find potential partners for hook-ups and relationships. There are a multitude of other options for such agendas that I am certain you will all know about. We would ask all members to be respectful of one another and treat everyone with courtesy. It is also essential to respect each member's privacy. While networking is an important aspect of the group, we ask you to exercise tact and discretion in order to create a comfortable environment for everyone. This is a social space and therefore any form of business solicitation or promotion is strictly prohibited. Please also be advised that member contact details will not be shared by the group in order to respect privacy.</p>
<p>We have no age restrictions and welcome the diversity. As soon as we get a ""reasonable"" number of members, we will host a meet. As this group is still a work in progress, I am open to any ideas or potential collaberators.</p>",98645762,Aman

<p><b>Introduction</b> &lt;br&gt;While there are many Filmmaking Groups on Meetup, none of them are regular, and most of them have been inactive for months, or even years. Therefore, they are either dead groups, or their pace of work is terribly slow. <b>This is, therefore, the SOLE Active Filmmaking Group on Meetup.</b> &lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>&lt;br&gt;While we have been growing steadily, we slowed down the pace, so that members answer a few questions to figure out whether they really want to be part of the filmmaking community, or have merely joined the group to socialise. We could have easily crossed 1000 members in September of this year, but that is not our purpose. We want members who are passionate and dedicated, and members who are regular.</p> 
<p>Your interests can be in Short Films, Feature Films, Web Series or TV.</p> 
<p>Members who are looking for long-term collaborations would be preferred. Also, to ensure they get something out of this group, members should try and attend weekends for filmmaking, if they cannot make it during the week.</p> 
<p>Delhi has enormous potential and talent. Let's channelise this talent to create great content, that we can be Proud of.</p> 
<p>Also, this Group is for filmmakers and film enthusiasts from Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and all the other cities of the NCR (National Capital region). This group is therefore open to Everyone who is within the NCR.</p> 
<p>If you are Serious about making films, and are open to collaborating and working with other members, <b>THIS</b> is the group for you. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is not essential that you have your own equipment or prior film experience, what is <b>IMPORTANT</b> is that you are passionate about making films, and want to pursue that passion.</p> 
<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> 
<p>Let's Meet and Collaborate.</p>

<p>This meetup group is an extension of a larger online community for Indian Widow(er)s and Divorcees. We call it 'The Phoenix Family'. </p>
<p>Who are we? </p>
<p>We are a group of widow(er)s, divorcees and separated individuals who have taken up this initiative to form an online community. The community is named ‘The Phoenix Family’, the name is derived from mythological bird phoenix which is cyclically regenerated or reborn like most of us. Why this initiative? The community is formed with the base that people who have the same emotional setbacks/upheavals connect better. When a person is entering this phase, they are always daunted by questions like what next, why me, how to cope. Some learn it the hard way. This “family” as we love to be called will help in the transition with their experience. All and any help is welcomed here be it emotional or any other advice. Needless to say a light hearted talk with trusted friend is a welcome break, at any time. </p>
<p>What do we do? We function as one big family. A family where you could say ‘when my spouse was alive, we used to go on trips regularly’ and still not get that pitiful look. A group where you could say ‘I feel a bit lonely these days’ and don’t get the regular ‘find a guy and get married’ advice. You could confess that ‘you do not have time for your kid and not comfortable stepping out alone with the kid’ and hear back ‘most of us are in the same boat, let us get together and go out somewhere’. So in short you could say and share your feelings without any qualms. </p>
<p>Where are we? We have members from all over India in our secretive Facebook group. Members are added after screening and through invitation.

<p>FAQ </p>
<p>But I do not need any emotional support… So do most of our members! We do not turn to our family only for support right? You could help others or just be with a trusted group. </p>
<p>How secure am I in this … This community was founded in February of 2014. We are currently around 130 members (as of March 2018). This should show that we do not have any commercial inclination of growing us by taking in random members. In fact the administrators block at least 3 fake requests to join the group every week. We have core members who act as spy to keep tab of ‘suspicious online Romeos (and juliets??!) ’, fortunately we have not got any one who has sneaked in so far. We take our members security very very seriously. </p>
<p>NOTE : If you are looking for ""fun"", please stay away from here. We will be closely monitoring members activity, if you are found disturbing fellow members with private messages. Members will be banned. And admins decision is final in this regard. </p>",200085471,Vignesh Balan

<p> <br>About Us</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why some relationships are so much happier than others while others live lives of quiet desperation? What causes the love in a relationship to last? Or what causes love to die? What makes friends or family members stick together for life? Or what causes them to drift apart?</p>
<p>The founders of Kutumb Relacare Nomads have been looking for answers to these questions for years. And they found out something interesting: &nbsp;for friends and family to have a healthy relationship, just meeting them or staying together is not enough. A healthy relationship is one that grows with time; not only do people in healthy relationships stay together, but they enjoy spending “quality time” with each other. People in healthy relationships stay together because they relish and enjoy each other’s company!</p>
<p>Such strong bonding can develop in several ways. But some of the most powerful ways to do it is to travel with ones you love. The founders also found out that the best relationships, whether it be friends or family, the best bonding happens when they travel together. Human beings connect to a deeper part of their soul when they travel and connect with nature. Amidst that connection with nature, they also connect with each other a lot better!</p>
<p>Another way to bond with people you love is to play with them, have high-quality fun conversations and do adventurous, recreational activities together. As Plato once said, “You can learn more about a person in a hour of play than in a year of conversation.”</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that the founders of Kutumb have immersed themselves into understanding patterns in human behavior. They are experts at shifting unconscious patterns that create the results they experience in their lives. They are experts at evolving human beings fast. They have worked on medical limitations as well as have worked with people to evolve their capabilities of connecting with people. Their skill set, their intuitions for noticing patterns that need to change for individuals and their relationships to evolve is the single greatest skill set that sets them apart from any other organisation&nbsp;in the world. And what makes Kutumb programs different is the fantastic accelerated learning technologies integrated into the program, that allow for people to fully absorb and apply these life-changing distinctions in their own lives. &nbsp;</p>",3503969,Harsh Singhal

<p><span>Gnosis is therefore the universal knowledge of the intimate Self. </span><span>The teachings do not just provide theories and ideas, but give several practices and meditations through which we reach what is known as Self-gnosis, thus testifying​ the truth and reality about the mysteries of life and death.</span><br></p>
<p>​<span>The student begins to learn by studying different states of consciousness, the wakeful, the dreaming, mindfulness, etc., and then by gradually perceiving more and more until reaching connection with the true inner being. This gives us the power to make more conscious decisions, have a broader perspective of our existence, and have better solutions to daily inner and exterior crisis ​that surround us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>​<span>Everybody that seeks to know the mysteries of the universe and the even greater mysteries of the Self&nbsp;is offered this opportunity to attend profound esoteric lectures and communicate with like-minded people, to begin their personal development and investigations through these studies.</span></p>

<p>– Hopelessness. One feels hopeless in every aspect of his life, whether it is relationship, job or health.</p>
<p>– Indulging in reckless behaviour. Heavy alcohol abuse, drug abuse and many of other addictions that are potentially harmful.</p>
<p>–Self hatred. Now this one is the biggy. The one suffering from depression has a persistent feeling that he is not enough. Their consciousness is transformed into something that constantly compels people to hate themselves.</p>
<p>–Feeling tired. Lack of energy in the body so that even the little everyday household chores cant be done properly. This may also be due to countless other causes but in case it occurs with other symptoms, this is not something to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>There is one other aspect to the concept of depression that is very heavily misunderstood. The link between creativity and depression, which has been mentioned a lot of times in the number of studies on the condition. The people who are engaged in more creative works such as the writers, painters and musicians are more prone to depression. <br>""We can help""</p>",219510590,Manish Mohan

<p>Yes! The group is newcomer friendly. We have a good number of games and invariably there is at least one newcomer at the table, so normally the rules are explained before every game starts. That said, game complexity ranges widely. So before joining a game, ask the person who brought the game or whoever explains the rules how easy or complex the game is.

25693179,Sound Meditation Therapy,meetup-group-OHqCsTfd,https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-OHqCsTfd/,0,1504011825e3,"<p><b>Personal or Group Sound Therapy Session</b></p>
<p>Most of us are “out of tune” with our complex physical and subtle bodies. People suffer physical pains and aches such as headaches and migraines, lack of energy, joint pains, digestive problems, organ dysfunction, sciatica, back problems etc or mental and emotional pain like low self-esteem, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, fears and worries.</p>
<p>Sound Yoga- Sound Vibration Therapy with the Sound Yoga singing bowls has shown a remarkable and swift improvement in many cases with physical or mental and emotional pain. Pains seem to melt away and one feels that emotional heaviness like worry or depression is lifted, leaving one to feel a pleasant lightness. The energy body, the aura, is cleared and one feels refreshed and as if a burden taken off one’s shoulders.</p>
<p>People have commented on the treatment: <i>“an amazing experience … I feel mental clarity … lightness in my joints … my backache is gone … felt deeply relaxed … feel very refreshed, better than having been on a 2 weeks’ holiday … felt like entering into a different world … felt blissful.”</i></p>
<p>The Sound Vibration Therapy affects each cell of the body. We can take the example of a lake. When a stone is thrown in it, the stone creates concentric movements of the water in this way the whole of the lake is put into motion. Similarly, when sounding the singing bowls on or near the body the vibration of the sound reaches each and every cell via the water in our body. Our body consists of about 80% of water and Dr. Emoto has proven in his extensive research that water is an excellent carrier of information. The healing sound vibration will gently flow into the body, affecting the structure and health of cells and organs favourably. Disease is a disharmony of the vibration of the cells, tissues, organs and the SVT has an immediate beneficial effect starting to bring the vibrating cells back into its harmonious state.</p>
<p>The subtle vibration can be very precisely directed by placing the singing bowls on or near a tensed area of the client’s dressed body. The bowls are struck with a felt mallet. The issuing vibration leads to first loosening the stagnant energy and then helps it to be rearranged.</p>
<p>Hearing and being bathed in the harmonious sounds leads to rapid and effective deep relaxation and undo stress. They help you to deal effectively in daily life and enhance your creativity. New energies will be freed and self-healing will be mobilized. </p>
<p>The rich overtones take you into a very deep place inside yourself – rarely experienced by people – from there clarity may appear in the way of seeing solutions about long-held problems which may come as a flash of an image into your mind. </p>
<p><b>The only requirement for the client is to listen.</b></p>

<p>Small business - is the big business of the world and it represents 80% of all employers. Small businesses produce 55 percent of innovations, twice as many per employee as large businesses.</p>
<p>History sets a very good example that all the big things which exist in the world today had small beginnings. We all have to start at some point of time, from somewhere, with limited resources and knowledge or experience, having no support to live our dream someday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry experts claim that most of the businesses&nbsp;fail within five years of start-ups which is true but in fact no expert guarantee the success of the business when it is at start-up phase. The businesses can be saved if it is well planned, properly executed and timely monitored under the predefined norms and these norms again have to be updated periodically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us live under the impression that if ""I"" know the core of work then I will be successful which is completely false. An entrepreneur must have deep knowledge on ""How to start a successful business"" and ""How to run it profitability"" which has a series of step by step algorithm.</p>
<p>Using this platform we will try to share as much as possible all relevant information which is required for the start-ups.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested to speak one on one then please feel free to message us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also designed three months dedicated very intense course for Business start-ups and thousands of people have benefitted with it around the Globe. You can enroll for these classes as well.

A good team is the key for successful business and building a good team having good vibes, the right energy, and trust is one of the biggest challenges.

Having said that , I am one of those young Indian’s who have started this ecosystem in India long back , and doing so one of the things we have been doing actively is to educate and nurture the new generation and the society with the Blockchain Technology. Even doing this for a long time where we have trained thousands of hours globally &nbsp;by workshops , online trainings etc we have observed that by just training we are not helping the ecosystem as audience needs to be enabled with the skill set. Hence to cater this need we realized we need to enable the “ Makers culture in Blockchain” , hence we have formed “<b>DIYblochain” which stands for Do It Yourself Blockchain and enabling the makers culture in blockchain. </b>In this initiative we are not just going to train people but will them opportunity to get there hands dirty with the technology too by providing them live projects and products to work on post the trainings and other mode of learning. </p>

If we need to adapt this technology&nbsp; , we need skilled people.&nbsp;The Demand For Blockchain Engineers Is Skyrocketing, But we do not enough resources as per Forbes. Hence we need to create the resource by educating people not just by training on different programs but also enabling them . The biggest problem in the entire ecosystem is that Blockchain is not just some tech its an ecosystem which we are calling Internet 3.0 and we need to build the ecosystem by all possible ways.&nbsp;</p>

Our biological instinct is to turn away from the emotional pain, and this, when accumulated over time, causes emotional wounds. This leads to a constant feeling of being sad, lost and something missing in life without any reason.&nbsp;This is because the emotional wounds are buried deep inside and is not a part of our conscious anymore. Engaging in different activities gives us a temporary sense of being and happiness, but it's not for long. The reason is the cause is not resolved and the only solution is to, acknowledge the wound and work on that.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p><b>“Art can PERMEATE the very deepest part of us,&nbsp; where no WORDS exist” </b>~ Eileen Miler</p>
<br>
<p>Mandala literally meaning a circle in Sanskrit is an ancient term and a healing art form is known for centuries. The term symbolically represents our inner the universe and depicts our inner current self at the time of practicing it, making our unconscious conscious at the moment or in simple terms makes unknown known without using a word to explain. Because of this benefit, the Mandalas are used by many psychologists worldwide as a therapeutic tool for their clients.&nbsp;They can be used for mere relaxation to getting relieved from the emotional burden and much more.</p>
<br>
<p><b>About me:</b></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Neha.&nbsp; I am an Expressive Art Therapy Facilitator, working towards self-development and bringing a positive change in the life of people around me and my clients. I love changing the limiting beliefs to the empowering ones.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>I had been working as an HR professional and have an experience of 8+ years in the domain. While working for so many years with Human Resources and dealing with people around, I realized that everyone is set on a journey of their own, but very few of them know the way towards a better life. Majority of them are simply lost in their way because of the distractions caused by their everyday life events and issues, either leading to an emotional wound or triggering it.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>My primary goal as an Expressive Art Therapy facilitator is to help people to be free from these emotional burden and trauma caused by them, by engaging people into an unconscious art journey. This results in making people aware of the underlying issues and acknowledges them, which is the first step towards Healing. The sessions help people in looking deeply into the issues and finding ways to resolve them or to come to terms with the issues so that they do not bug anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>I have read this somewhere: Art therapy serves just like seeing yourself truly into an old dusty mirror. Initially, the image is dirty and blurred because of the emotional wounds and trauma. But, as you keep cleaning the mirror with your unconscious efforts of art, the image gets clearer and clearer. It’s like cleaning your soul off of any negativity.</p>",154044182,Kraaftify

27783501,Healing Mandala,Healing-Mandala,https://www.meetup.com/Healing-Mandala/,0,1520672883e3,"<p>Emotions are the part of our daily lives which involves both positive and negative emotions. Our biological instinct is to turn away from the emotional pain, and this, when accumulated over time, causes emotional wounds. This leads to a constant feeling of being sad, lost and something missing in life without any reason.&nbsp;This is because the emotional wounds are buried deep inside and is not a part of our conscious anymore. Engaging in different activities gives us a temporary sense of being and happiness, but it's not for long. The reason is the cause is not resolved and the only solution is to, acknowledge the wound and work on that.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p><b>“Art can PERMEATE the very deepest part of us,&nbsp; where no WORDS exist” </b>~ Eileen Miler<br><br></p>
<p>Mandala literally meaning a circle in Sanskrit is an ancient term and a healing art form is known for centuries. The term symbolically represents our inner the universe and depicts our inner current self at the time of practicing it, making our unconscious conscious at the moment or in simple terms makes unknown known without using a word to explain. Because of this benefit, the Mandalas are used by many psychologists worldwide as a therapeutic tool for their clients.&nbsp;They can be used for mere relaxation to getting relieved from the emotional burden and much more.<br><br></p>
<p><b>About me:</b></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Neha.&nbsp; I am an Expressive Art Therapy Facilitator, working towards self-development and bringing a positive change in the life of people around me and my clients. I love changing the limiting beliefs to the empowering ones.&nbsp;<br>I had been working as an HR professional and have an experience of 8+ years in the domain. While working for so many years with Human Resources and dealing with people around, I realized that everyone is set on a journey of their own, but very few of them know the way towards a better life. Majority of them are simply lost in their way because of the distractions caused by their everyday life events and issues, either leading to an emotional wound or triggering it.&nbsp;<br>My primary goal as an Expressive Art Therapy facilitator is to help people to be free from these emotional burden and trauma caused by them, by engaging people into an unconscious art journey. This results in making people aware of the underlying issues and acknowledges them, which is the first step towards Healing. The sessions help people in looking deeply into the issues and finding ways to resolve them or to come to terms with the issues so that they do not bug anymore.&nbsp;<br>I have read this somewhere: Art therapy serves just like seeing yourself truly into an old dusty mirror. Initially, the image is dirty and blurred because of the emotional wounds and trauma. But, as you keep cleaning the mirror with your unconscious efforts of art, the image gets clearer and clearer. It’s like cleaning your soul off of any negativity.</p>",154044182,Kraaftify
27793364,MSME Connect,MSME-Connect,https://www.meetup.com/MSME-Connect/,0,1520750954e3,"<p>“MSME Connect”, a program to reach out to the MSMEs is being organized by Confederation of Indian Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (CIMSME) at Northern Bangalore on 24th March'2018. MSME Department, SIDBI and NSIC will be joining us at MSME Connect.</p> 
<p>The Objective of MSME Connect is to enable MSMEs to face challenges in the globalized market by providing information on various schemes offered by Central and State Government, incentives packages offered by banks and financial institutions and vendor development by connecting large scale industries with small and medium scale. Integrating MSMEs to qualified buyers and service provider for value addition.</p> 
<p>Understanding Background The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) are a significant contributor to the equitable growth of the Indian economy. Several reports and studies available in public domain estimate that the MSME sector contributes nearly 8 percent of the country’s GDP and about 40 percent of India’s exports*. Moreover, such reports state that this sector generates the largest share of employment after agriculture with an estimated 48 million units including a phenomenal range of products and services. Importantly, a KPMG report – The New Wave Indian MSME estimates a considerable increase in the MSME contribution to India’s GDP, increasing up to around 15 percent by 2020.</p> 
<p>Despite this extensive contribution, several issues and hurdles sail this sector including limited access to funds/debt, high entry barriers for technology, competition for skills and branding etc. As a result, despite steady encouragement from the government in terms of financial and policy support, limited availability of timely and adequate funds at a reasonable cost remains a challenge for the MSME sector.</p> 
<p>Apart from this, cost of credit (both interest rates for non-collateral as well as collateral backed loans) is often very high and at times prohibitive. Traditionally, the finance providers have viewed the MSME sector with skepticism on account of typically low capitalization, the paucity of financial and accounting records, lack of sufficient collateral, relatively higher risk perception of such businesses etc.</p> 
<p>Available research studies on MSME sector financing reveal that demand for funds by the MSME sector, which is estimated at INR 32.5 trillion ($650 billion), is met by either formal or informal source. Moreover, the financing is sourced from self-finance, informal sources and from the formal financing sector. It is interesting that informal sources and self-finance together make up most of the finance channeled into the sector at an estimated 78% of the total fund demand as stated above.</p> 
<p>Among the formal sector, providers of Finances to MSMEs include Banks, governmental institutions, financial Institutions; NBFCs and even Micro Credit Lenders. The suite of financial products usually made available to MSMEs is summarized below.</p> 
<p>Types of Key Fund-Based Products offered to the MSME Sector:</p> 
<p>Cash Credit/Overdraft – Based on Hypothecation of stocks/receivables with Additional Security (optional) – and/or Immovable property, allowing typical Loan to Asset Value of 50-60% with tenure of one year, renewable thereafter.</p> 
<p>Term Loans – Secured by Mortgage land, building, factory, residence allowing up to 80% Loan to asset value with a tenure ranging from 1-15 years.</p> 
<p>Asset-Based Financing – Secured by contracts, accounts receivable, invoice, letter of credit, inventory, machinery, equipment. Allowing Loan to Asset Value of up to 90% with a tenure of 1-7 years.</p> 
<p>Credit Cards – Revolving Credit based on Third-party Guarantee, hypothecation of stock receivables allowing the maximum limit of INR 10 Lacs allowing a tenure of up to 3 years;</p> 
<p>Some Non-Fund Based Products Offered to MSME Sector by Banks and NBFCs include:</p> 
<p>Letter of Credit – Letter of Credit is beneficial to export-oriented MSME units; Importers make use of products like ‘Buyer’s Credit’. Credit is available for procuring raw material, manufacturing the goods, packaging and shipping the goods.</p> 
<p>Bank Guarantee – Bank Guarantees are extended for making the advance payment, giving tender money, security deposit, etc.</p>",246823684,CIMSME

It is a forum for those who are fed up with the inherent hypocritical and double faceted tendencies present in this society and those people who preach us virtues and conducts that they themselves don’t follow. It is a forum for an open exploration into actual nature of truth and the essence of life and to discover what is of vital importance for our personal growth without which life would be meaningless and incomplete. It is a forum for those who have the willingness to see the truth as it is and derive their conclusions from the truth discovered by the process of impartial, objective and non prejudiced way of thinking without subscribing to the glossy and stereotypical colouring with which it is usually presented to us. It is a forum where we will jointly explore all these issues and many more enabling us to jointly travel into the realms of our mind and remove those obstacles and stumbling blocks that are preventing us from living a more complete, meaningful and gratifying life and thus challenging those archaic dogmas and beliefs that are enimical to our well being and growth. It is also a forum for all these seekers of truth to get to know each other and form a bond of friendship and comredeership.</p>",250901934,Vladimir Kaushik

28101190,Open Heart Meditation and Reiki Tummo - Delhi,OpenHeart-ReikiTummo-Delhi,https://www.meetup.com/OpenHeart-ReikiTummo-Delhi/,0,1523287043e3,"<p>On the surface level Open Heart Meditation is a very simple yet effective way to shut the busy mind down, relax and unwind, and to reconnect with peace. Many people come as a quick way to recharge for the week and to find inner peace.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>On a deeper level Open Heart Meditation is about opening the heart to know your True Self and to connect with our Creator - the ultimate source of love and life - what we call ""True Source"". The divine energy from True Source (the Reiki energy) is a beautiful restorative energy of healing, joy, love and blessings. It's suitable for people from all religions because it's non denominational and helps people to better connect with their chosen spiritual path - experientially through the heart (rather than through the head with more thinking and theory).</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>When you are connected to this abundant source of life energy every day, you will in turn receive life more abundantly. It will improve your overall happiness, health, and general well-being. You will find yourself more calm and less reactive; your choices in life will be more sound and centred; and you will be more in line with your True Self - all beyond the limited intelligence of the mind, other worldly wisdoms, and fluctuating emotions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The greater purpose of this practice for those who wish to pursue it beyond relaxation and healing is to return home - back to our Creator from where we all originated from - the ultimate source of life and unconditional love, detached from the cycles and struggles of the earth dimension.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Open Heart Meditation is therefore very different to many popular types of meditation, such as Mindfulness Meditation for the following reasons:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>• It does not rely on the mind or observation, or on emotions, but rather it is focused on the heart. We teach you how to easily shut the mind down, to open the heart, and sense from it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>• Instead of practicing detachment, we teach you to attach to the source of abundant life first. This will then help you detach from all forms of negativities naturally without any effort. In doing so, this will gradually iron out negative reactive responses, smoothing your life's path.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>• This blessing, is a gift of Grace and cannot be earned by greater effort. The only thing one can do is to just receive this gift from the heavens with an open heart, in gratitude.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This group is dedicated to those who would like to learn, practice and share about Open Heart Meditation, Reiki healing, and Kundalini. Everyone is welcome to join, learn and contribute in a positive, safe and caring environment. :-)</p>

It is important to see and experience how the ‘real’ world lives -- a world where 80% of humanity lives and uses only 20 % of its resources … a world that lives off-grid … a world that lives with its own rules. Our own village republics of India. </p> 
<p>There is a growing awareness about the benefits of this vernacular way of life -- among the other 20% population who consume 80% of resources. This is getting reflected in obsession with everything organic and non-urban. But there is an increasing disconnect between the aspirations of those living in villages, and those living in the cities of India. The twain need to meet – discuss - deliberate and engage with each other so as to learn and understand each other.</p> 
<p>Come … Let’s travel to listen to this ‘other’ India… Live in a monastery up in Spiti … In a village where you can pick your own vegetables and cook a meal … Experience a people’s collective where you learn hands-on to sow and reap … Meet a farmer who loves birds … Pick peas and apples up in the Himalayas … Bathe in the glacial melt (if you are upto it) after a 45-minute trek … Live next to a school in Kutch …Encounter a lot more excitement.</p>",136008152,Priyanka Bhaskar

<p>More often than not, women struggle to feel and believe that they are phenomenal. ""You are not smart...you are not beautiful...you are not enough..."" Lies the world tells us growing up or we end up telling ourselves along the way. We keep waiting for 'that' special moment when we would move the mountains and the world would finally acknowledge our presence. ""Only then, I will truly feel phenomenal"", we tell ourselves. But, is this the best way to live a happy, fulfilling and adventurous life? And what happens when we stumble, fall and feel like giving up? What happens when we suddenly find ourselves alone on this long, winding path? </p> 
<p>We need to be fierce. We need to accomplish. We need to feel wild and sexy and all those wonderful things that we really are. We need to believe that we can be who we want to be...And, we need to have a deep rooted belief that we are phenomenal! yes, even on those days when we don't have heart to even get out of the bed. </p> 
<p>And, for that, we need to change our attitude and take solid actions. We need to educate and empower ourselves. We need to learn more about the world. We need to be inspired by lives of strong and intelligent women in the history who shaped the course of the world we are living in today. We need to set goals and diligently work towards their realization. We need to voice our thoughts and opinions, loud and clear so that the world responds. We need to nurture our mind, body and spirit. We need to understand how to love ourselves and others around us. </p> 
<p>This is certainly not easy, but surely is possible. And we will have a group of friends who will be walk with us on this journey, who will push us to chase our dreams, who will lift us up when we are down, who will teach us new things and also, who will make this journey a lot more fun. </p> 
<p>What will we do?<br>1. Learn about the world: Reading on women's history or books by various authors (we will start with women authors); If you are not that into books, you can certainly watch few videos online :)<br>2.

<p>“Art can PERMEATE the very deepest part of us, where no WORDS exist” ~ Eileen Miler</p> 
<p>Emotions are the part of our daily lives which involves both positive and negative emotions. Our biological instinct is to turn away from the emotional pain, and this, when accumulated over time, causes emotional wounds. This leads to a constant feeling of being sad, lost and something missing in life without any reason. <br>This is because the emotional wounds are buried deep inside and is not a part of our conscious anymore. Engaging in different activities gives us a temporary sense of being and happiness, but it's not for long. The reason is the cause is not resolved and the only solution is to, acknowledge the wound and work on that. </p> 
<p>About me:<br>Hi, I’m Neha. I am an Expressive Art Therapy Facilitator, working towards self-development and bringing a positive change in the life of people around me and my clients. I love changing the limiting beliefs to the empowering ones. </p> 
<p>I had been working as an HR professional and have an experience of 8+ years in the domain. While working for so many years with Human Resources and dealing with people around, I realized that everyone is set on a journey of their own, but very few of them know the way towards a better life. Majority of them are simply lost in their way because of the distractions caused by their everyday life events and issues, either leading to an emotional wound or triggering it. </p> 
<p>My primary goal as an Expressive Art Therapy facilitator is to help people to be free from these emotional burden and trauma caused by them, by engaging people into an unconscious art journey. This results in making people aware of the underlying issues and acknowledges them, which is the first step towards Healing. The sessions help people in looking deeply into the issues and finding ways to resolve them or to come to terms with the issues so that they do not bug anymore. </p> 
<p>I have read this somewhere: Art therapy serves just like seeing yourself truly into an old dusty mirror. Initially, the image is dirty and blurred because of the emotional wounds and trauma. But, as you keep cleaning the mirror with your unconscious efforts of art, the image gets clearer and clearer. It’s like cleaning your soul off of any negativity.</p>",154044182,Kraaftify

This group equally welcomes all- believer &amp; non-believer; religious &amp; non-religious; theist, atheist &amp; agnostics, as divine reality is that we all are One.

The aim is to uniting spiritual enthusiasts &amp; explorers, having compassion in their hearts, and who are ready to act to awaken the divine within than without. Let us break the myth that spirituality is for the renunciates alone.</p>

<p>1. You are a spiritual seeker and love to be in the company of similar enthusiasts and share your anecdotes, natural or supernatural experiences, esoteric knowledge, which people in general might not be empathetic towards.</p>
<p>2. You are Not a spiritual seeker but have millions of What? Why? How? When? Who? questions about life, your existence, the world, and the Universe around you.</p>
<p>3. You love being in the space with people sharing the similar interests in subjects like Metaphysics, God, Divine, Heaven &amp; Hell, Enlightenment, Meditation, Guru-Disciple, Self-realisation, and so on...</p>

<p>7. Finally, if you believe that Supreme Truth is One for All, irrespective of any caste, creed, religion or sect. In spiritual reality we all are One.</p>

<p>The idea of creating this group is to reach out to working professionals in and around Delhi who are stuck on the treadmill. Here is your chance to get in touch with nature and unwind with our detox and wellness programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are the sessions we plan to arrange under our wellness programme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YOGA STYLES&nbsp; <br>*Ayurveda</p>
<p>To make these sessions more effective and result oriented we will be choosing venues that are simply idyllic.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span>We are conducting these programmes at <a href=""http://www.himalayanecoresort.co.in/"">Carnoustie Himalayan Eco Resort.</a> It is situated in the epicenter of beauty and peace. Located at a height of 7000 feet above the sea level in the Sirmour district of Himachal Pradesh, India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The resort is surrounded by pristine Deodar trees that lead up to Churdhar Peak, which is a 6-hour hike from the resort. Moreover, there are other numerous short treks and walks with scenic views which are perfect for family vacation. A stream from the river Giri runs through the resort. Most of the vegetables and fruits are grown organically here and used in resort’s kitchen. Resort’s scenic and pristine location makes it an ideal place to de-stress the mind and body. The resort is about 90 kilometers away from the city so it’s completely noise and pollution free. In a nutshell, we believe that the location of the resort has favorable weather conditions which renders it to be an ideal location for the participants to rejuvenate.</span> <br></p>
<p>Come join the Delhi Wellness Group on this path of wellness,&nbsp;<span>and unwind in the arms of nature.</span></p>
